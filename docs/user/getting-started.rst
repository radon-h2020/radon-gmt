Getting Started
###############

Launching with Docker
*********************

.. note::
   It is recommended that your host or virtual machine has at least 2GB of memory.

Open a command prompt and execute the following command:

.. code-block::

   docker run -it -p 8080:8080 \
     -e PUBLIC_HOSTNAME=localhost \
     -e WINERY_FEATURE_RADON=true \
     -e WINERY_REPOSITORY_PROVIDER=yaml \
     -e WINERY_REPOSITORY_URL=https://github.com/radon-h2020/radon-particles \
     opentosca/radon-gmt

Launch a browser: `<http://localhost:8080>`_.

.. note::
   To start Eclipse Winery based on an TOSCA XML repository layout, use the following command:

   .. code-block::

      docker run -it -p 8080:8080 \
        -e PUBLIC_HOSTNAME=localhost \
        -e WINERY_REPOSITORY_URL=https://github.com/OpenTOSCA/tosca-definitions-public \
        opentosca/winery

.. note:: 
   Make sure you regularly pull the latest images:

   .. code-block::

      docker pull opentosca/radon-gmt:latest
      # or
      docker pull opentosca/winery:latest


Use a custom TOSCA model repository
-----------------------------------

**Problem:**
You want to use an existing TOSCA model repository that you have cloned, e.g., to add new or adapt existing TOSCA types and blueprints in this Git repository.

Please follow the next instructions to mount an existing TOSCA model repository into the Eclipse Winery container.
This is useful if you want to save your modeling changes onto your Docker host machine. 

Clone or create git repository on your local filesystem, e.g., by cloning `<https://github.com/radon-h2020/radon-particles>`_.

Open a command prompt and execute the following command:

.. warning::
   Replace ``<path_on_your_host>`` with the respective dirctory path on your host system.

.. code-block::

   docker run -it -p 8080:8080 \
     -e PUBLIC_HOSTNAME=localhost \
     -e WINERY_FEATURE_RADON=true \
     -e WINERY_REPOSITORY_PROVIDER=yaml \
     -v <path_on_your_host>:/var/repository \
     -u `id -u` \
     opentosca/radon-gmt

Launch a browser: `<http://localhost:8080>`_.

Any change (create service template, modify or create node types) will be reflected on your host machine.
You are now able to commit your changes and push them to your own Git remote (e.g., using ``git push`` from a command-prompt).

.. note::
   To start Eclipse Winery based on an TOSCA XML repository layout, use the following command:

   .. code-block::

      docker run -it -p 8080:8080 \
        -e PUBLIC_HOSTNAME=localhost \
        -v <path_on_your_host>:/var/repository \
        opentosca/winery


Model and version your applications and company-specific types only
-------------------------------------------------------------------

**Problem:**
You want to model applications based on actively maintained TOSCA type repositories but you want to version/save only your own application blueprints and company-specific types inside your (private) Git repository (GitHub, GitLab).

You are able to start Eclipse Winery in a so-called "multi-repository" setup where you can add several TOSCA type repositories that you can use for your application models. 
However, with this setup, Eclipse Winery creates a specific "workspace" that only contains your company-specific types and application blueprints (separated by namespace).
You can then mount the created "workspace" to save your modeling results to your own Git remote.

Open a command prompt and execute the following command:

.. warning::
   Replace ``<path_on_your_host>`` with a respective dirctory path on your host system.

.. code-block::

   docker run -it -p 8080:8080 \
     -e PUBLIC_HOSTNAME=localhost \
     -e WINERY_FEATURE_RADON=true \
     -e WINERY_REPOSITORY_PROVIDER=yaml \
     -e WINERY_DEPENDENT_REPOSITORIES="[ { \"name\" : \"RADON Particles\", \"url\" : \"https://github.com/radon-h2020/radon-particles.git\", \"branch\" : \"master\" } ]" \
     -v <path_on_your_host>:/var/repository \
     -u `id -u` \
     opentosca/radon-gmt

Your created TOSCA service templates or company-specific TOSCA node types will be stored on your host machine.
You are now able to commit your changes and push them to your own Git remote (e.g., using ``git push`` from a command-prompt).


Launching with Docker Compose
*****************************

.. note::
   It is recommended that your host or virtual machine has at least 2GB of memory.

Install Docker and `Docker Compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose>`_.

Clone the repository:

.. code-block::

   git clone https://github.com/eclipse/winery
   cd winery/deploy/compose

**[Optional]** Adapt the Docker Compose configuration to your needs, e.g., to mount a local TOSCA model repository.

Start Winery:

.. code-block::

   docker-compose up

Launch a browser: `<http://localhost:8080>`_.
